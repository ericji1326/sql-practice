# Eric's SQL Practice Repo

Thanks for visiting my github! This repository is just my attempt to get a little more proficient with SQL. I have put it off for far too long and I really want better and faster at writing queries.
I stumbled across a [website](https://www.sql-practice.com/) called sql-practice. It's pretty fun! I suggest you try it.
